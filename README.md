# Functional Operations on Data Sets

This project involves solving various tasks related to data manipulation using functional programming operations such as `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and others. The tasks are described below along with the corresponding Python code solutions.

## Task 1: Student Performance Statistics

Suppose we have a list of dictionaries representing student data and their grades in different subjects. Each dictionary contains information about the student's name, age, and a list of grades (integers) for different subjects. We want to accomplish the following tasks:

1. **Data Filtering:** Filter students based on specific age and/or a specific list of subjects.
2. **Data Transformation:** Calculate the average grade for each student and the overall average grade across all students.
3. **Data Aggregation:** Find the student (or students) with the highest average grade.

### Solution:
The Python code for solving these tasks is provided in the `students` section of the code.

## Task 2: Total Expenses Calculation for Users with Specified Criteria

We have a list of users with information about their expenses over certain periods of time. The tasks involve the following steps:

1. **Filtering Users:** Filter users based on specified criteria.
2. **Calculating Total Expenses:** Calculate the total expenses for each user.
3. **Calculating Total Expenses for Filtered Users:** Obtain the total expenses for all filtered users.

### Solution:
The Python code for solving these tasks is provided in the `users` section of the code.

## Task 3: Working with a Large Database of Orders and Customers

We are given a large database of orders and customers represented as lists of dictionaries. The operations include:

1. **Order Filtering:** Filter orders only for a specific customer with a given customer ID.
2. **Calculating Total Order Amounts:** Calculate the total amount of all orders for a given customer.
3. **Calculating the Average Order Cost:** Find the average cost of orders for a given customer.

### Solution:
The Python code for solving these tasks is provided in the `orders` section of the code.

## Usage:
The provided Python code snippets demonstrate how to perform the specified tasks using functional programming operations. You can integrate these solutions into your projects as needed.
